# Final-Year-Project
 This is my FYP which is a smart home web-app that should function using a smart home envirnment that I have configured 

 # How to run the app
The way if you wish to run the application of this webpage is to cd into the frontend folder and make sure you have nodejs and react instlalled then run the command npm start. The next step to run the backend is to cd into the backend folder and run the command npm run backend which should work only if you're ip is configured to be allowed access to mongodb which only i can add the ip to it so sadly running the backend can only be accomplished by me but I can for limited time allow all access from any ip but for that to work I would need to know the rough timeframe the person wants to view the app at. The other option is to change the mongodb connection string in the server.js file in the backend folder. This would allow you to connect to your mongodb cluster and thus would work with my code minus the dataset that I already have saved currently in the database.
